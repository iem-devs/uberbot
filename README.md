# uberbot

uberbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework, to run the commands to the popular ride service [Uber](https://www.uber.com/). It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Running uberbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start uberbot locally by running:

	```
    % HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=<slack_token> UBER_SERVER_TOKEN=<uber_server_token> ./bin/hubot --adapter slack
    ```

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    uberbot>

Then you can interact with uberbot by typing `uberbot help`.

    uberbot> uberbot help
    uberbot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    uberbot help - Displays all of the help commands that uberbot knows about.
    ...
